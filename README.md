This is my attempt at making a networked, caching, content-addressed, replicating file database with easy FUSE access.
I think my goals are similar to bazil.org/bazil except a little less ambitious.  Also I care more about replication than
anything else.  This builds on the excellent bazil.org/fuse and uses boltdb to store file metadata.

Currently... Nothing works!
